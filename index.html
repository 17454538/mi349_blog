            <h3>Review: <em>Murmur</em></h3>

        <p>Release in 1983, <em>Murmur</em> was one of the most anticipated LPs of the alternative scene in the 1980s. After debut EP <em>Chronic Town</em> drew the band considerable attention with its infectiously jangly guitar and arcane lyricisms, Murmur was the perfect follow-up to cement the band as college radio sensations. It expanded on the jangle pop sound of <em>Chronic Town</em> with higher production quality and an impressive roster of consistently catchy tracks. Lead single “Radio Free Europe” became the band’s first charting track, notably one of the first songs to break from the college circuit into the mainstream.</p>

        <p>I had been an R.E.M. fan since my youth, but it wasn’t until my freshman year of college that I heard Murmur in its entirety, and I was hooked almost immediately. "Radio Free Europe" was already a favorite of mine, but I was amazed at just how many gems were hidden in the album’s deeper cuts, from "Moral Kiosk" to "Catapult". Though the ballads are definitely a cut below the rest (Talk About the Passion and Perfect Circle may be certain fan favorites, but I’m not among them), there’s hardly a bad song on the record, and it’s unquestionably one of the strongest debut albums of all time.</p>

            <h3>Review: <em>Automatic for the People</em></h3>
            <p>By Blake Kaufman -- <time datetime="2020-10-11">October 11th, 2020</time></p>
        </header>
        <img src = "Automatic.jpg" alt = "Automatic for the People album cover">
        <p><em>Automatic for the People</em> is a masterpiece. Michael Stripe croons out musings on death, rebirth, and the passage of time that flow together and drift apart like water. Every song paints a piece of the picture, and each song would be lesser without the others – not quite a concept album, but certainly more than a collection of songs. Coming off of the overwhelming commercial success of 1990’s <em>Out of Time</em>, the band finally had both complete creative freedom and a budget to support it, and their efforts paid off. The one-two-three punch of “Drive” to “Try Not to Breathe” to “The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite” can only be topped by the later “Man on the Moon” to “Nightswimming” to “Find the River”, and the fact that both of these exist on the same album is an incredible testament to the quality of songwriting R.E.M. exhibited in their prime. </p> 

        <p>Perhaps I am biased by nostalgia; Automatic for the People was the first album I ever owned and I have extremely strong memories of putting it on my old portable CD player nearly every night as I fell asleep when I was 10. Even so, I find myself returning to this album more than any other. </p>
